## *Disability in Archives: Reading Somatic Difference in the ECDA* 

## Description 
In collaboration with researchers from Northeastern University, I am drawing from the [Early Caribbean Digital Archive](https://ecda.northeastern.edu/) to examine the ways in which disability and somatic difference is represented within the 18th and 19th century documents. Particularly, we have agreed upon the following questions: (1) How/are somatic markers used as justification for enslavement? (2) Did disability constitute a form of resistance and in what instances? (3) How is the language around disability used in the 18th and early 19th-century Early Caribbean texts? Right now, this research is slated to take two forms: (1) the construction of a collection, which serves as a corpus of texts drawn from the archive that address disability; (2) an exhibit that highlights particular trends around disability within the corpus.
