# Current & Ongoing 

## *Dreaming the Cyborg: Technoableism & New Media*

## Description 

Note: This project grew out of a seminar paper for Dr. Tim Watson’s “Contemporary Criticism & Theory” course in the Fall of 2022. With Dr. Watson’s feedback and Dr. Lindsay Thomas’s guidance in data collection methods, I adapted the paper into a multi-modal project a conference at Texas Tech University: *The Humanities Center at Texas Tech Annual Conference 2023: “Health.”*

### Abstract 
This project will explore manifestations of technoableism in online discourse, and in turn, ask how disabled writers and activists respond critically to the notion that technology will eventually eliminate disability. It will draw upon analyses from my own working dataset, which aims to showcase trends based on data from the Twitter API and metadata from TikTok.  In addition, it will draw upon theorization from disability scholars such as Cy. Jillian Weise, Ashley Shew, and Leah Lakshmi Piepenza-Samarasinha. Weise’s concept of the “tryborg” will give way to an analysis of online portrayals of “bio-hacking” by able-bodied people. Shew’s understanding of “technoableism” will then serve as a means to assess the consequences of said portrayals. Finally, Piepzna-Samarasinha’s *The Future is Disabled* will offer language to grapple with disabled becomings. Because I am diabetic, this project will first draw heavily on discourse around diabetes technology in the context of social media. However, I will then branch out to explore wider forms of both ableism and resistance relating both to technology. Finally, I will assess how contemporary creative forms imagine and offer futures in which disabled people exist within the center. 

Keywords: *disability, technofuturism, ableism, technoableism, technology, pandemic*

### Datasets & Presentations
In the folder [linked here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yQ5pOPB78vnxlEBuU71tf3PTyRzRLxvW?usp=sharing) you will find two datasets: one containing data and metadata scraped from the Twitter API and one containing metadata scraped from TikTok using the [Pyktok Module](https://github.com/dfreelon/pyktok) created by Deen Freelon. You will also find a Slides presentation containing a simplified breakdown of the project and my preliminary findings.

## *Disability in Archives: Reading Somatic Difference in the ECDA* 

## Description 
In collaboration with researchers from Northeastern University, I am drawing from the [Early Caribbean Digital Archive](https://ecda.northeastern.edu/) to examine the ways in which disability and somatic difference is represented within the 18th and 19th century documents. Particularly, we have agreed upon the following questions: (1) How/are somatic markers used as justification for enslavement? (2) Did disability constitute a form of resistance and in what instances? (3) How is the language around disability used in the 18th and early 19th-century Early Caribbean texts? Right now, this research is slated to take two forms: (1) the construction of a collection, which serves as a corpus of texts drawn from the archive that address disability; (2) an exhibit that highlights particular trends around disability within the corpus.
