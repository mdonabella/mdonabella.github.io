### [*Dreaming the Cyborg: Technoableism & New Media*](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7897812)

### Description

This project explores manifestations of technoableism in online discourse, and in turn, asks how disabled writers and activists respond critically to the notion that technology will eventually eliminate disability. It draws upon analyses from my own working datasets, which aim to showcase trends based on data from the Twitter API and metadata from TikTok.  In addition, it borrows from theorization by disability scholars such as Cy. Jillian Weise, Ashley Shew, and Leah Lakshmi Piepenza-Samarasinha. Weise’s concept of the “tryborg” gives way to an analysis of online portrayals of “bio-hacking” by able-bodied people. Shew’s understanding of “technoableism” thens serve as a means to assess the consequences of said portrayals. Finally, Piepzna-Samarasinha’s *The Future is Disabled* offers language to grapple with disabled becomings.

### *Disability in Archives: Reading Somatic Difference in the ECDA*

### Description 
In collaboration with researchers from Northeastern University, I am drawing from the [Early Caribbean Digital Archive](https://ecda.northeastern.edu/) to examine the ways in which disability and somatic difference is represented within the 18th and 19th century documents. Particularly, we have agreed upon the following questions: (1) How/are somatic markers used as justification for enslavement? (2) Did disability constitute a form of resistance and in what instances? (3) How is the language around disability used in the 18th and early 19th-century Early Caribbean texts? Right now, this research is slated to (eventually) take two forms: (1) the construction of a collection, which serves as a corpus of texts drawn from the archive that address disability; (2) an exhibit that highlights particular trends around disability within the corpus.
