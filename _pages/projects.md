### [*Dreaming the Cyborg: Technoableism & New Media*](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7897812)

This project explores manifestations of technoableism in online discourse, and in turn, asks how disabled writers and activists respond critically to the notion that technology will eventually eliminate disability. It draws upon analyses from my own working datasets, which aim to showcase trends based on data from the Twitter API and metadata from TikTok.  


### [*Disability in Archives: Reading Somatic Difference in the ECDA*](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7898107)

In collaboration with researchers from Northeastern University, I am drawing from the [Early Caribbean Digital Archive](https://ecda.northeastern.edu/) to examine the ways in which disability and somatic difference is represented within the 18th and 19th century documents. We ask: (1) How/are somatic markers used as justification for enslavement? (2) Did disability constitute a form of resistance and in what instances? (3) How is the language around disability used in the 18th and early 19th-century Early Caribbean texts?
