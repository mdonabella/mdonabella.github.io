About Me
======
I am a third-year PhD student in Literary Studies at the University of Miami studying representations of disability and technology in contemporary internet and literary cultures. Prior to beginning my Ph.D., I earned my M.A. in English from the University at Buffalo. Outside of my work in postsecondary education, I have served as an instructor in various K-12 settings.
