About Me
======
I am a second-year PhD student in Literary Studies at the University of Miami. My primary research interests include disability studies, digital humanities, and contemporary literature. My current projects employ digital methods to analyze trends around disability representation in both contemporary media and archival materials. Prior to beginning my Ph.D., I earned my M.A. from the University at Buffalo, where I primarily studied modes of political representation in Irish modernism. Outside of my work in postsecondary education, I have served as an instructor in various K-12 settings.
