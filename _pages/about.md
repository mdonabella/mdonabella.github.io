About Me
======
I am a third-year PhD student in Literary Studies at the University of Miami researching representations of disability and technology within contemporary internet and literary cultures. Prior to beginning my PhD, I spent three years as a K-12 educator and received an M.A. in English from the University at Buffalo.
