About Me
======
I am a PhD candidate and Graduate School Dissertation Fellow at the University of Miami. My work centers disabled, chronically ill, and nonnormatively embodied writers and creators as they highlight implicit forms of ableism in speculative fiction and contemporary technologics. Prior to beginning my PhD, I taught high school English and earned an M.A. from the University at Buffalo.
