About Me
======
I am a PhD candidate and Graduate School Dissertation Fellow at the University of Miami. My research examines the intersections of disability and technology, gender, and labor in contemporary literary and online cultures. Prior to beginning my PhD, I worked as a high school English instructor in Miami, FL and earned an M.A. from the University at Buffalo.
