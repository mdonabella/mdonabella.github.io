### First-Year Writing II: Disability in the Media
#### University of Miami, Spring 2023
**Course Description:** This class will explore a range of contemporary media with an emphasis on the relationship between difference, disability, and society. We will examine how disability moves through different figurations in literature, art, and other forms of media. While we might be conditioned to think of disability as a visible impairment, we will take disability here to encompass both visible and non-visible illnesses and impairments. To expand our understanding of disability and the scope of our analyses, we will also utilize the term debilitation, which refers to fatigue, disability, and illness that emerge(s) slowly as a product of myriad structural and economic factors  (Puar 2017). Together, we will compare how disability manifests in different media and why those manifestations might look similar or different. We will ask questions such as: How do friends and family respond to the sudden onset of disability and illness? How are we conditioned to think about disability and illness in contemporary society? How is disability sometimes produced by the state, modes of production, or a combination of the two?  

### First-Year Writing I: Discourse Communities
#### University of Miami, Fall 2022
**Course Description:** WRS 105 will introduce you to the kinds of reading, writing and thinking that happen in the university community.  A single course cannot teach you all that there is to know about academic writing, nor can it provide you with a set of formulas to follow so that you will forever be a “good writer,” as “good” is always specific to genre and context. Instead, you will be asked to read several essays and articles and to participate in dialogue with authors’ questions, extend their projects, or make use of their ideas for your own purposes.  This course aims to engage you, then, in learning to learn, learning to think about what you are learning, and learning to express your ideas even as you figure out what those ideas might be. In this class, writing is not only an end product—something that you produce—but also an activity that allows you to think through a set of complicated issues, an activity that captures your mind at work even as it allows your mind to do its work.  

In this section of WRS 105, you will examine various approaches, styles and techniques used by the writers and then will develop your own texts either by following their examples, expanding them, or testing them and, in this way, enter into a critical conversation with the writers and their texts.  The writing assignments themselves are designed to help you engage in critical questioning, deploy more sophisticated rhetorical strategies, view texts as invitations for writing and thinking, and cite informally.
